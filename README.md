# Personal Loan Prediction
Thera Bankis a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these
customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The
number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the
bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in
the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management
wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers
(while retaining them as depositors).
The file contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic
information (age, income, etc.), the customer&#39;s relationship with the bank (mortgage,
securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign
(Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the
personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy
conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing
department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success
ratio.
As a Data scientist at Thera Bank have to build a model that will help the marketing
department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of
purchasing the loan.
